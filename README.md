# HotFurnaceItems

This plugin adds a chance that when taking an item out of the furnace, it will burn you. You will receive a certain amount of damage and effects specified in the settings.
In order not to get burned, you need to hold leather in your hand.

PS, 23.01.2022, I will continue developing this plugin a bit later. (probably)
